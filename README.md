# Quran-Pages
Quran pages in different formats

These are quran pages in different formats

"Crops" is just a folder of cropped screenshots from an app

"Monochrome" is the cropped screenshots turned to monochrome for SVG conversion

"SVGs" is those monochrome images converted to SVG using potrace

"PDFs" is the SVG pages converted to PDF

I can't upload the full book as the file is too large,
so you'll need to combine the pages using the python script
named "PDF merge.py"
